### Real-Time System Monitoring with AI Predictions
A real-time system monitoring application that tracks CPU, RAM, and disk usage and uses machine learning to predict future CPU utilization.

## Overview

This project continuously monitors system performance metrics and applies machine learning to predict CPU usage in advance.
It helps in proactive system management, performance analysis, and early alerting for high resource utilization.

## Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of CPU, RAM, and disk usage  
- AI-based CPU usage prediction  
- Live graphs for system metrics  
- Alert system for high CPU utilization  
- REST API built using FastAPI  
- Interactive web dashboard
  
## How It Helps
- Detects performance issues early  
- Predicts future CPU load  
- Improves system reliability  
- Useful for learning real-time AI system design


## How It Works 
 - Collects real-time CPU, RAM, and disk usage using the psutil library.
 - Stores collected system metrics as historical data for analysis.
 - Trains a machine learning model using stored data to understand system behavior.
 - Predicts future CPU usage based on current system conditions.
 - Displays live metrics, predictions, graphs, and alerts through a web dashboard.
